      <h3 class="affected-h3">Object Methods, "this"</h3>
      <ul class="objects-dom">
        <li>Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on</li>
        <li>Method Example:
          <div class="h-container">
            <ul class="h-size">
              <li><code>let user = {<br>name: "John",<br>age: 30<br>};<br><br>user.sayHi = function() {
                <br>alert("Hello!");<br>};<br><br>user.sayHi(); //Result: Hello!</code></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li>A function that is a property of an object is called its <span class="emphasize"><i>method</i></span></li>
        <li>In this example code, the method is <code>sayHi</code> and the object is <code>user</code></li>
        <li>When writting code using objects to represent entities, thats called <span>object-oriented programming</span>
          in short: "OOP"
        </li>
        <li>There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:
          <div class="h-container">
            <ul class="h-size">
              <li><code>//these objects do the same<br><br>user = {<br>sayHi: function() {<br>alert("Hello");<br>
              }<br>};<br><br>//method shorthand looks better, right?<br>user = {<br>sayHi() { 
                //same as "sayHi: function(){...}"<br>alert("Hello");<br>}<br>};</code></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>It's common that an object method needs to access the info stored in the object to do its job</li>
        <li>In this same example, if we need the name of the the user (the object), a method can be used to call
            the method
          <div class="h-container">
            <ul class="h-size">
              <li><code>sayHi() {<br>//"this" is the "current object"<br>alert(this.name);<br>}<br>};<br>
              <br>user.sayHi(); //Result: John</code></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          It's also possible to access the object without <code>this</code>, by referencing it via the outer variable (but such code is unreliable)  
        </li>
        <li><code>this</code> is not bound &#8594 It can be used in any function, even if it's not a method o an object
          <ul>
            <li>Dot or square brackets ("[]") access the method - doesn't matter</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In JavaScript <code>this</code> is "free", its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where 
          the method was declared, but rather on what object is "before the dot"</li>
        <li>Arrow functions have no "this"
          <ul>
            <li>Arrow functions are special: they don't have their "own" <code>this</code>
              <div class="h-container">
                <ul class="h-size">
                  <li><code>user = {<br>firstName: "Ilya",<br>sayHi() {<br>let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
                    <br>arrow();<br>}<br>};<br><br>user.sayHi(); //Result: Ilya</code>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>        
      </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 class="affected-h3">Object (From JavaScript: Novice to Ninja)</h3>
      <ul class="objects-dom">
        <li>One way to think about an object is that it's like a dictionary where you look up a property
          name and see a value &#8594 like a database of values</li>
        <li>JS objects are similar to a hash or associative array in other programming languages</li>
        <li>They are used to keep any related information and functionality together in the same place</li>
        <li>They also provide a useful way of organizing your code without polluting the global namespace</li>
        <li>It's also possible to create an object using a constructor function &#8594 <code>const spiderman
          = new Object(); //not recommended however</code></li>
        <li>Dot notation is much more common, but bracket notation has a few advantages
          <ul>
            <li>It's the only way to access nonstandard property and method names that don't follow the variable naming rules</li>
            <li>Also  lets you evaluate an expression and use it as the property key</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="affected-h3">Checking if Properties or Methods Exist and Finding all the Properties of an Object</h3>
      <ul class="objects-dom">
        <li>The <code>in</code> operator can be used to check whether an object has a particular property</li>
        <li><code>hasOwnProperty()</code> &#8594 This can be used to check whether an object has a property that is
          its own, rather than one that has been inherited from another object
          <ul>
            <li>This method will <i>only</i> return any properties that belong to that particular object</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We can loop through all of an object's properties and methods by using a <code>for in</code> loop
          <div class="h-container">
            <ul class="h-size">
              <li><code>for(<i>const</i> key <i>in</i>superman) {<br>console.log(key + ": " +
                superman[key]);<br>}</code></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li><code>Object.keys()</code> &#8594 This method returns an array of all the keys of an object that is
          provided as an argument
          <div class="h-container">
            <ul class="h-size">
              <li><code>for(const key of Object.keys(superman)) {<br>console.log(key);<br>}<br><br>
                //can use something similar with just the values &#8594 Object.values()</code></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li><code>Object.entries()</code> &#8594 Returns an array of key-value pairs</li>
        <li>New properties and methods can be added to objects at any time in a program
          <ul>
            <li>It's important to note that properties don't always appear in the order they were entered</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="chunk-4">
      <h3 class="affected-h3">Namespacing and Built-in Objects</h3>
      <ul class="objects-dom">
        <li>Naming collisions occur when the same variable or function name is used for different purposes
          by code sharing the same scope
        </li>
        <li>The problem becomes more likely if you code libraries from other developers or work on code in
          teams, as you might choose the same name for a function<br>as another member of the team
        </li>
        <li>A solution to this problem is to use the <span class="emphasize">object literal pattern</span> to
          create a namespace for groups of related functions</li>
        <li>JavaScript has a number of other built-in global objects that cn be accessed from anywhere in a 
          program
        </li>
        <li><span class="emphasize">JSON</span> &#8594 JavaScript Object Notation is an extremely popular lightweight data-storage format
          that is used by by a large number of services for data serialization and configuration
          <ul>
            <li>The beauty of JSON is that it manages to hit the sweet spot between being both human-and 
              machine-readable
            </li>
            <li>Property names must be double-quoted</li>
            <li>Permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false, null, arrays and objects</li>
            <li>Functions are not permitted values</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="h-sizes"><code>const batman = '{"name": "Batman","real name": "Bruce Wayne",<br>"height": 74, 
          "weight": 210, "hero": true, "villain": false,<br> "allies": ["Robin","Batgirl","Superman"]}'</code></li>
        <li><code>parse()</code> &#8594 This method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object</li>
        <li><code>stringify()</code> &#8594 This method takes a JavaScript object and returns a string of JSON data</li>
        <li>These methods are particularly useful when it comes to sending data to, and receiving data from,
          a web server using Ajax requests, or when using localStorage to store data on a user's machine
        </li>
        <li>The <code>Math</code> object is a built-in object that has several properties representing mathematical constants, as
          well as methods that carry out a number of common mathematical operations
          <ul>
            <li><code>Math.PI</code> &#8594 The ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle</li>
            <li><code>Math.SQRT2</code> &#8594 The square root of 2</li>
            <li><code>Math.E</code> &#8594 Euler's constant</li>
            <li><code>Math.LN10</code> &#8594 The natural logarithm of 10</li>
            <li><code>LOG10E</code> &#8594 The log base 10 of Euler's constant</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mathematical Methods &#8594 The <code>Math</code> object also has several methods to carry out a variety of
          useful mathematical operations:
          <ul>
            <li><code>Math.abs()</code> &#8594 A method that returns the absolute value of a number</li>
            <li><code>Math.ceil()</code> &#8594 A method that will round a number up to the nearest integer, or
              remain the same if it's already an integer</li>
            <li><code>Math.floor()</code> &#8594 A method that will round a number down to the next integer, or
              remain the same if it is already an integer</li>
            <li>...and so much more</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
