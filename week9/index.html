            <ul class="bom">
              <li><span class="emphasize">The Browser Object Model (BOM)</span> &#8594; A collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen</li>
              <li>The BOM properties and methods are made available through the <code>window</code> object</li>
              <li>Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a <code>window</code> object</li>

          <h3 class="affected-h3">Going Global</h3>
          <ul class="bom">
            <li>Global variables are created without using the <code>const</code>, <code>let</code> or <code>var</code> keywords
              (can be accessed in all parts of the program)
            </li>
            <li>Global variables are actual properties of a global object</li>
            <li>In a browser environment, the global object is the <code>window</code> object &#8594; meaning that any global variable created
              is actually a property of the <code>window</code> object
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>x = 6; //Global variable created
<< 6

window.x //Same variable can be accessed as a property of the window object
<< 6

//Both variables are exactly the same
window.x === x;
<< true
</code>
</pre>
</div>
              In general, you should refer to global variables without using <code>window</code> object;
              it's less typing and your code will be more portable between environments
            </li>
            <li>Some functions we've already met, such as <code>parseInt()</code> and <code>isNaN()</code>, are actually methods of the global object,
              which in a browser environment makes them methods of the <code>window</code> object
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>window.parseInt(4.2);                                                      
<< 4

window.isNaN(4.2);
<< false
</code>
</pre>
</div>
              <span class="emphasize">ES6 made <code>parseInt(4.2)</code> and <code>isNaN</code> methods of the <code>Number</code> object, so they can be both be 
                called using the following code:</span>
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>Number.parseInt(4.2);

        <div class="chunk-3">
          <h3 class="affected-h3">Dialogs</h3>
          <ul class="bom">
            <li><code>window.alert()</code> &#8594; This method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box; message is provided
              as an argument to the method, and <code>undefined</code> is always returned
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
window.alert("Hello");                                                      
<< undefined
</code>
</pre>
</div>
            </li>     
            <li><code>window.confirm()</code> &#8594; This method stops the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided
              as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
window.confirm("Do you wish to cancel?");                                                      
<< undefined
</code>
</pre>
</div>              
            </li>
            <li><code>window.prompt()</code> &#8594; This method will stop the execution of the program and displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument,
              as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text; the text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK (if user clicks Cancel, null is returned):
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
window.prompt("Please enter your name:");                                                      
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                There are some occasions when this functionality can be used as an advantage, for example, a <code>window.confirm</code> dialog can be  used as a final check to see if a 
                user wants to delete a resource. This will stop the program from going ahead and deleting a resource while the user decides what to do
              <span class="emphasize"></span>
            </li>
            <li>Which Browser:
              <ul>
                <li><code>Navigator</code> &#8594; This object contains information about the browser being used</li>
                <li><code>userAgent</code> &#8594; This property will return information about the browser and operating system being used</li>
                <li><span class="emphasize">Don't rely on the information result that comes out, as it can b modified by a user to masquerade as a different browser</span></li>
              </ul>

            <li>Location, Loction, Location
              <ul>
                <li><code>window.location</code> &#8594; This property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page (contains a number of properties that provide 
                  information about different fragments of the URL
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
window.location.href
<< "https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                This property (as well as most of the others in this section) is a read/write property, which means it can also be changed by assignment
                </li>
                <li><code>protocol</code> &#8594; This propert returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.). Note that there is a colon (:) at the end:
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
window.location.protocol
<< "https:"
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                </li>
                <li><code>host</code> &#8594; This property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number (this is often omitted if the defualt port 80 is used):
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
window.location.host
<< "www.sitepoint.com"
</code>
</pre>
</div>             
            <code>hostname</code> &#8594; This property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL     
                </li>
                <li><code>port</code> &#8594; This property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL</li>
                <li><code>pathname</code> &#8594; THis property returns a string of the path that follows the domain</li>
                <li><code>search</code> &#8594; This property returns a string with a "?" followed by the query string parameters</li>\
                <li><code>hash</code> &#8594; This returns a string with a "#" followed by a fragment idetinfiier</li>
                <li><code>origin</code> &#8594; This returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from (read only)</li>
                <li><code>reload()</code> &#8594; This method can be used to force a reload of the current page (If parameter returns true, it will force the browser
                  to reload the page from the server, instead f using a cached page
                </li>
                <li><code>assign()</code> &#8594; This method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
window.location.assign("https://www.sitepoint.com/");
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                </li>
                <li><code>replace()</code> &#8594; This method is almost the same as the assign method, except the current page will not be stored in the session history, so the user will be unable
                  to navigate back to it using the back button
                </li>
                <li><code>toString()</code> &#8594; This method returns a string containing the whole URL</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="chunk-4">
          <h3 class="affected-h3">The Browser History</h3>
          <ul class="bom">
            <li><code>window.history</code> &#8594; This property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session</li>
            <li><code>window.history.length</code> &#8594; This property shows how many pages have been visited before</li>
            <li><code>window.history.go()</code> &#8594; This can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
window.history.go(1); //Goes forward 1 page
window.history.go(0); //Reloads the current page
window.history.go(-1); //Goes back 1 page
</code>
</pre>
</div>
            There are also the <code>window.history.forward()</code> and <code>window.history.back()</code> methods that can be used to navigate forwards and backwards by one page
            </li>
            <li>Controlling Windows:
              <ul>
              <li>A new window can be opened using the <code>window.open()</code> method &#8594; Takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its
                second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
const popup = window.open("https://sitepoint.com", "SitePoint", "width=400,height=400,resizable=yes");
</code>
</pre>
</div>
              </li>
              <li>The <code>close()</code> method can be used to close a window, assuming you have a reference to it; it's also possible to move a window
                using the <code>window.moveTo()</code> method (takes two parameters that are the X and Y coordinates of the screen that the window is to be moved to)
              </li>
              <li>You can resize a window using the <code>window.resizeTo()</code> method; it takes two parameters that pecify the width and height of the resized window's dimensions
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
window.resizeTo(600,400);
</code>
</pre>
</div>
              </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Screen Information:
              <ul>
                <li>The <code>window.screen</code> object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on (can find the height and width properties respectively)</li>
                <li>The <code>availHeight</code> and <code>availWidth</code> can be used to find the height and width of the screen, excluding any operating system menus
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
window.screen.height
<< 1024

window.screen.width
<< 1280

window.screen.availWidth
<< 1280

window.screen.availHeight
<< 995
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                </li>
                <li>The <code>colorDepth</code> property can be used to find the color depth of the user's monitor, although there are few use cases for doing this other than
                  collecting user statistics
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The Document Object
              <ul>
                <li>Each <code>window</code> object contains a document object</li>
                <li><code>document.write()</code> &#8594; This method simply writes a string of text to the page (if a page has already loaded,
                  it will completely replace the current document
                </li>
                <li>The <code>document.write()</code> method can also be used within a document inside <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to inject a string into the markup</li>
                <li><span class="emphasize">The use of <code>document.write()</code> is heavily frowned upon as it can only be realistically used by mixing JavaScipt within an HTML document</span></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cookies:
              <ul>
                <li><span class="emphasize">Cookies</span> &#8594; These are small files that are saved locally on a user's computer</li>
                <li>Browsers do not remember anything from one request to another, so everytime a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered</li>
                <li>Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can be retrieved between requests</li>
                <li>A restriction of cookies is that they can only be read by a web page from the same domain that set them</li>
                <li>They can be used for personalizing a user's browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices, authentication and tracking users</li>
                <li>They're still useful for retaining state information (such as if a user is logged in) because they're passed between the client and server on every HTTP request</li>
                <li>Creating Cookies:
                  <ul>
                    <li>To create it, you assign it to JavaScipt's "cookie jar", using the <code>document.cookie</code> property
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
document.cookie = "name=Superman";
<< "name=Superman"
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  The <code>document.cookie</code> property acts like a special type of string. Assigning another cookie to it won't overwrite the entire property, it will just append it
                  to the end of the string
                </li>
                <li>Changing Cookie Values
                  <ul>
                    <li>A cookie's value can be changed by reassigning it to <code>document.cookie</code> using the same name but a different value</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Reading Cookies
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      To see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter <code>document.cookie</code>:
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
document.cookie:
<< "name=Batman; hero=true; city=Gotham"
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                      We can use the <code>split</code> method to break the string into an array containing each name/value pair, then use a <code>for of</code> to iterate through the array
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
const cookies = documents.cookie.split("; ");
for (crumb of cookies) {
  const [key, value] = crumb.split("=");
  console.log(`The value of ${key} is ${value}`);
}

<< The value of name is Batman
The value of hero is true
The value of city is Gotham
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cookie Expiry Dates
                  <ul>
                    <li>Cookies are sessions cookies by default &#8594; Meaning they are deleted once a browser session is
                      finished (when the user closes the browser tab or window)
                    </li>
                    <li>An alternative is to set the <code>max-age</code> value. This takes a value in seconds, but it wasn't supported in IE before version 10</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Path and Domain of Cookies:
                  <ul>
                    <li>By default, cookies can only be read by pages inside the same directory and domain as the file was set</li>
                    <li>The path can be changed so that any page in the root directory can be read the cookie. It's done by adding the string "; path=/" to the end of the cookie when it is set
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
document.cookie = "name=Batman; path=/"
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                      A cookie can only be read by the domain that created it anyway, but doing this will allow all subdomains of sitepoint.com to read it 
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Secure Cookies:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Adding the string ";secure" to the end of a cookie will ensure it's only transmitted over a secure HTTPS network:
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
document.cookie = "name=Batman; secure";
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Deleting Cookies:
                  <ul>
                    <li>To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time in the past:
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
document.cookie = "name=Batman; expires= Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT";
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h3 class="affected-h3">Timing Functions</h3>
          <ul class="bom">
            <li><code>window.setTimeout()</code> &#8594; This method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter</li>
            <li>It can also cancel the timeout using the <code>window.clearTimeout()</code> method</li>
            <li><code>setInterval()</code> &#8594; This method works in a similar way to <code>window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number milliseconds</code></li>
            <li>Animations:
              <ul>
                <li>The <code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code> methods can be used to animate elements on a webpage</li>
                <li>The <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> of the <code>window</code> object works the same way as the <code>window.setInterval()</code> method, although it has a number of improvements to optimize its performance</li>
                <li>These include making the most of the browser's built-in graphics-handling capabilities, and not running the animation when the tab is inactive, resulting in a much smoother performance</li>
                <li>To start the animation, we need to call this method, giving the <code>rotate()</code> function as an argument</li>
                <li>This will return a unique ID that can be employed to stop the animation using the <code>window.cancelAnimationFrame()</code> method</li>

                <li>Include an optional string value
<div class="h-container">

          <h3 class="affected-h3">HTML5 APIs</h3>
          <ul class="bom">
            <li>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card</li>
            <li>HTML5 Web Storage:
              <ul>
                <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client's computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use</li>
                <li>The crucial differences with cookies:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Information stored is <i>not</i> shared with the server on every request</li>
                    <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same)</li>
                    <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies</li>
                    <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, <code>window</code> object will have a property called <code>localStorage</code>, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data</li>
                <li>There is also a <code>sessionStorage</code> object that works in the same way, although the data is only saved for the current session</li>
                <li>Rather than using the <code>getItem()</code> and <code>setItem()</code> methods, assignment can be used instead</li>
                <li>To remove an entry from local storage, use the <code>removalItem</code> method</li>
                <li>To completely remove everything stored in local storage, use the <code>clear()</code></li>
                <li>Every time a value is saved to local storage, a <code>storage</code> event is fired</li>
                <li>The event object sent by the event listener to the callback has a number of properties that provide information about the updated item
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>key</code> tells us the key of the item that changed</li>
                    <li><code>newValue</code> tells us the new value to which it has been changed</li>
                    <li><code>oldValue</code> tells us the previous value before it was changed</li>
                    <li><code>storageArea</code> tells us if it is stored in local or session storage</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The fact that only strings can be saved might seem like a restriction at first, but by using JSON, we can store any JS object in local storage</li>
                <li>The Web Storage API provides a useful way of storing various types of information on a user's computer without the restriction of cookies</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Geolocation
              <ul>
                <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device</li>
                <li>It can be used to find the user's exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving</li>
                <li>It can then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel</li>
                <li>Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the user first</li>
                <li>If it's available, it will be a property of the <code>navigator</code> object</li>
                <li>This property has a method called <code>getCurrentPosition()</code> that will return a <code>position</code> object to a specified callback function called youAreHere()
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                  The <code>position</code> object passed to the <code>youAreHere()</code> function has a <code>coords</code> property with a <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code>
                  property, which together give the coordinates of the device
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
function youAreHere(position) {
  console.log(`Latitude: ${position.coords.latitude}, Longitude: ${positions.coords.longitude});
}
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                </li>
                <li><code>position.speed</code> property returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second</li>
                <li><code>position.altitude</code> property returns an estimate of the device's altitude in meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is a standard measurement for the center of the Earth</li>
                <li><code>position.heading</code> property returns the direction the device is moving in. This is measured as a bearing in degrees, clockwise from North</li>
                <li><code>position.timestamp</code> property returns the time that the position information was recorded</li>
                <li>It also has other properties that calculate the accuracy of the measurements; it can be useful, as sometimes you only need to know the town or city users are in, while at other times you many need their
                  exact position
                </li>
                <li><code>position.accuracy</code> property returns the accuracy of the latitude and longitude properties in meters</li>
                <li>The <code>geolocation</code> object has a <code>watchPostition()</code> method that will call a callback function every time the position of the device is updated</li>
                <li>The <code>clearWatch()</code> method can be used to stop the callback being called, using the ID of the watch as an argument</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Web Workers
              <ul>
                <li>Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript</li>
                <li>To get started, use the <code>Worker()</code> constructor function to create a new worker:
<div class="h-container">
<pre class="h-size">
<code>
const worker = new Worker("task.js");
</code>
</pre>
</div>
                </li>
                <li>If the file exists, it will be downloaded asynchronously</li>
                <li>The worker will only start once the file has finished downloading completely (otherwise, and error is thrown)</li>
                <li>Web workers use the concept of messages to communicate back and forth between the main script and worker script</li>
                <li>The <code>postMessage()</code> method can be used to send a message and start the worker working</li>
                <li>When a message is posted, a message event is fired, so they can be dealt with using an event listener</li>
                <li>When a worker has completed its task, it can be stopped using the <code>terminate()</code> method from within the main script</li>
                <li>Or using the <code>close()</code> method from inside the worker script</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Shared Web Workers
              <ul>
                <li>You can also create shared web workers that allow lots of different scripts on the same domain to access the same worker object</li>
                <li>Web workers allow computationally complex operations to be performed in a separate thread, meaning that the flow of a program won't suffer interruptions,
                  and an application will not freeze or hang
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Service Workers
              <ul>
                <li>The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able to intercept network requests</li>
                <li>Service workers require a secure network to run on HTTPS to avoid any malicious code hijacking networking requests</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Websockets
              <ul>
                <li>Websocket is an new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server-also known as push messaging, meaning that a connection is kept open and resonses are "pushed" to the client as soon as they are received</li>
                <li>When the code <code>new WebSocket(URL) runs, it creates an instance of a WebSocket object and tries to connect to the URL</code></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Notifications
              <ul>
                <li>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications</li>
                <li>An advantage of using the system notification is that they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the current tab</li>
                <li>This can be achieved using the <code>requestPermission()</code> method of a <code>Notification</code> global object</li>
                <li>The notification instance has a number of events that it can react to, including <code>click</code>, <code>show</code> and <code>close</code></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Multimedia
              <ul>
                <li>HTML5 introduced the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page</li>
                <li>It also introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript</li>
                <li>Any content inside the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tags will only display if the browser does not support them; hence it can be used to 
                  display a message to users of older browsers without support for these features
                </li>
                <li>The play() method will start the clip playing from its current position:</li>
                <li>The pause() method will pause the clip at its current position:</li>
                <li>The volume property is a number that can be used to set the audio volume:</li>
                <li>The muted property is a boolean value that can be used to mute the audio:</li>
                <li>The currentTime property is a number value that can be used to jump to another
                  part of the clip:</li>
                <li>The playbackRate property is used to fast-forward or rewind the clip by changing its value. A value of
                  1 is playback at normal speed:</li>
                <li>The duration property can be used to see how long the clip lasts</li>
                <li>The audio and video elements bring native support for multimedia into the
                  browser, and the API gives developers full control of the playback of audio tracks
                  and video clips.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h3 class="affected-h3">Shims and Polyfills</h3>
          <ul class="bom">
            <li>There is where a shim or a polyfill comes in handy &#8594; These are libraries of code that allow you to use the APIs as usual</li>
            <li>They then fill in the necessary code that's not provided natively by the user's browser</li>
            <li>The main difference between shim and polyfill is that a shim is a piece of code that adds some missing functionality to a browser, although the implementation method may differ slightly from the
              standard API
            </li>
            <li>A polyfill is a shim that achieves the same functionality, while also using the API commands that would be used if the feature was supported natively</li>
            <li>This means that your code can use the APIs as normal and it should work as expected in older browsers</li>
            <li>The advantage here is that the same set of standard API commands can be used-you don't need to write additional code to deal with different levels of support</li>
          </ul>
