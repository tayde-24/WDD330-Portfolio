        <div>
            <p>I did a couple of examples from this chapter to see how they worked dealing with arrays.</p>
            <p>I have the heroes array printed here through the <code>for</code> loop:</p>
            <p id="demo"></p>
            <p>I didn't add anything to index 3 and 4 to see if it did come out undefined, and it did.</p>
            <p>The rest can be found in <code>Console</code> through inspection. I used different properties and methods to see for myself how they affected the arrays I played around with.
            You can also check in <code>Sources</code> to see my JavaScript file. Like I said previously in the first exercise, it doesn't look nice, but for the purpose of just practicing,
            this should suffice for now. I'll make sure that in future JavaScript coding, I'll write it better.</p>
