      <ul class="intro">
        <li>When writing an application you are communicating with the user</li>
        <li>Any information stored or shared with the user is called an <span class="emphisize">output</span></li>
        <li>Anything coming in from where it was stored, or anything the user enters is called input
          <ul>
            <li><span>To techies, input and output are called IO, Input-Output</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="affected-h3">Building the HTML (Review for me)</h3>
      <ul class="building-html">
        <li>Make sure to give the page tab a title. Also make sure the title makes sense 
          with the content that's being <br>presented there</li>
        <li><span class="emphasize">What is a placeholder?</span> <span>&#8594</span> 
          <span>A placeholder is a property specific to textarea's and input tags</span>
          <ul>
            <li>Basically, it can be used to put a hint to your user</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>There are different levels of header tags:
          <div class="h-container">
          <ul class="h-size">
            <li><h1>h1 <span>&#8594</span> The largest</h1></li>
            <li><h2>h2 <span>&#8594</span> A little small</h2></li>
            <li><h3>h3 <span>&#8594</span> Getting smaller</h3></li>
            <li><h4>h4...h6 <span>&#8594</span> Gets even smaller. You get the idea.</h4></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        </li>
        <li><span class="emphasize">Section Tags</span> <span>&#8594</span> Represents an area
            or chunck of the page when it's displayed in your web browser</li>
        <li>By adding the "onclick" listener in the button tag, it plays out the function you program it to do</li>
        <li>Adding CSS can not only make the page work better, but it also makes the web page look pleasing 
          <br>to the user's eyes
          <ul>
            <li>Only when done well that is. Simplicity it <b>the key</b></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>It doesn't matter what order you put the functions in. JavaScript can handle any order</li>
        <li><span class="emphasize"> What is <i>var</i>?</span> <span>&#8594</span> Variable
          <ul>
            <li>Example imagery: It's like a box you can put stuff</li>
            <li>Make sure it matches the variable; otherwise, it will get confusing and may not work</li>
            <li>Example: <span class="box">var storyName = document.getElementById("name_input").value</span></li>
            <li>The "id" gets the element value under that id name</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="emphasize">What is <i>local storage</i>?</span> <span>&#8594</span> It stores any information you want to use later.
          <ul>
            <li>It uses key-value pairs</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="affected-h3">Master Mobile UX Video</h3>
      <p class="gist">This is the basically the gist from what I got from the videos:</p>
      <ul class="video-clip">
        <li>
          We need to rewire our brain to start with the mobile UX first, and then slowly make adjustments for 
          <br>different screen sizes (will make adjustments with these webpages throughout this course to do just 
          <br> that)
        </li>
        <li>Get into the perspective of the user, not just the developer</li>
        <li>Keep in mind accessibility and the flow of the website</li>
        <li>Make forms simple and easy</li>
        <li>Slow loading pages/websites will make users move on to the next website that can fulfill what they need</li>
